Robert F. Engle showed that Wald test, likelihood-ratio test and Lagrange multiplier test are asymptotically equivalent. Although they are asymptotically equivalent, in finite samples, they could disagree enough to lead to different conclusions.


## Student's t test


## Wald test 

+ Has an asymptotic $\chi^2$-distribution under the null hypothesis. 

+ Is used to determine ‘significant’ variables from the set of predictors.

+ Test statistic for assessing D-dimensional $\boldsymbol{\beta}$:

$$
W = (\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \boldsymbol{\beta}_0)^T (\text{Var}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}))^{-1} (\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \boldsymbol{\beta}_0) \sim \chi^2_{(D)} \text{ under }H_0,
$$
where $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate. 


+ Test statistic for assessing univariate $\beta$:

$$
W = \frac{(\hat{\beta} - \beta_0)^2}{\text{Var}(\hat{\beta})} \sim \chi^2_{(1)} \text{ under }H_0. 
$$



## Chi-squared test


## ANOVA



## Likelihood-ratio test
